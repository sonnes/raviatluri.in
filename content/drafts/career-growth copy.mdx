title: Career Growth - Beyond IC vs Manager

Recently, a colleague asked me, _"What was some of the good mentoring advice that helped you become a Senior Principal Engineer?"_ This question made me reflect on how we typically think about career growth in software engineering.

The traditional view presents career progression as a binary choice: you either stay on the Individual Contributor (IC) track or switch to the management track. But in my experience, this oversimplified model doesn't capture the true nature of career growth in our field.

Let me illustrate this with a scenario:

Imagine you're a CXO launching a critical, game-changing initiative. You have three candidates to choose from:

- A software architect skilled at building systems and applications
- A manager with a track record of delivering results and managing effective teams
- Someone who regularly contributes to code and architecture while successfully managing complex projects

Who would you pick to lead? The answer might not be as straightforward as you think.

## Rethinking Career Growth

While most companies define career ladders as mutually exclusive paths - either management or IC - I've developed a different mental model over my years working across various organizations and roles. This model views career growth as an interplay of three dimensions:

- Spectrum of Skills
- Problems to be Solved
- Sphere of Influence

True growth means expanding in all three dimensions, though not necessarily linearly or simultaneously. Let's explore each dimension in detail.

## Spectrum of Skills

Your journey typically begins as a software engineer, focusing on mastering programming languages, frameworks, and tools. You start by picking up tasks, writing code, and fixing bugs.

As you progress, you begin tackling architecture problems. While you're still coding, you're also creating architecture documents, designing systems, and evaluating trade-offs. This is when you start engaging in discussions, debates, and consensus-building. You begin collaborating with product teams, designers, and business stakeholders while building your reputation.

But here's the key insight: while technical skills dominate early career stages, you're simultaneously developing people skills and process understanding. The real mindset shift comes from realizing that skills are skills - they're not confined to technical or managerial boxes. Reaching senior levels isn't about becoming either a better coder or a better manager - it's about developing whatever skills you need to get things done effectively.

## Problems to be Solved

Early in your career, you work on assigned tasks - coding, reviewing, deploying, and marking them complete. As you advance, you handle more complex tasks and eventually lead initiatives and projects. However, the real growth begins when you start identifying problems yourself.

Problems exist everywhere - in codebases, architecture, product experience, and processes. The key is developing the ability to:

1. Identify issues that others might miss
2. Build compelling narratives around why these problems matter
3. Research and develop effective solutions
4. Execute and iterate on those solutions

This cycle of problem identification and solution becomes your engine for skill acquisition and career growth. The problems will evolve, but this fundamental approach remains constant.

## Sphere of Influence

Drawing from Stephen Covey's concept of "circle of influence," think of your influence as a sphere that expands in multiple directions. This influence isn't tied to titles or positions - it's about creating visibility for your work and ideas.

Your narratives should always connect your work to its broader impact, whether that's on:

- Team effectiveness
- System architecture
- Product success
- Business outcomes

To be truly effective, your influence needs to extend in multiple directions - across technology, product, processes, and people. You should be able to communicate effectively with peers, managers, and cross-functional teams.

## Balancing Growth in Practice

While this three-dimensional model might seem straightforward, implementing it is challenging. You'll constantly juggle multiple projects, initiatives, and responsibilities. You can't simultaneously focus on learning new skills, solving complex problems, and building influence.

Think of this model as a compass rather than a strict roadmap. It's perfectly fine - and often necessary - to focus on one dimension at a time. The key is maintaining awareness of all three dimensions while making conscious choices about where to direct your energy.

## The Role of Titles and Accountability

While titles and roles are important markers of career progression, they shouldn't be your primary focus. They define accountability and scope of work, but they don't limit what you can learn or how you can grow.

For example, a tech lead is accountable for service uptime, but that doesn't prevent them from learning new technologies or architectural patterns. You can follow the traditional title-based career progression, or you can chart your own path by continuously learning, solving meaningful problems, and building your reputation.

Remember: Focus on expanding your skills, tackling increasingly complex problems, and growing your sphere of influence. The roles, titles, and compensation will naturally follow.

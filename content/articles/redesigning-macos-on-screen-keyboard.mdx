I got bored of the macOS on-screen keyboard that I have been using for years. I had a brainwave and decided to redesign it. I knew nothing about SwiftUI or Swift, so I obviously got my partner-in-getting-shit-done to build it for me.

So far, I have been using the [mac's built-in accessibility](/articles/my-mac-accessibility-setup) keyboard since 2022.

Last year, I built [September](/articles/building-september), a communication assistant for myself to talk to my son and wife. But by the time I switched to a browser, opened the app, and typed out the message, my 8-year-old son's attention would have left the room. Also, my son started taking advantage of the long pauses to auto-approve permissions for things I might need him to do. He will walk into my room, ask me something, and immediately loudly declare "Mom, dad said okay! I can have 6 chocolates now".

You see where this is going.

So my big idea was to build everything - typing, my voice, notes, stories, etc. - all into one on-screen keyboard.

I used [Pencil](https://www.pencil.dev), a Claude-powered design tool, to try to give some shape to my ideas. After some back-and-forth, Claude came up with these designs.

You can read the full conversation [here](/transcripts/redesigning-macos-on-screen-keyboard.html). The transcript is generated by [Chitragupt](https://github.com/sonnes/chitragupt), yet another brainwave recently built by my ghost-coder.

We are living in incredible times where there are absolutely no barriers to building anything. If we can imagine it, AI can build it.

I can't type with my hands, I use a head-mounted mouse and every click takes 0.8 seconds. Yet, Claude allows me to build at incredible speed.

What's your excuse?

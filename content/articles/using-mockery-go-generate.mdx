This is a simple example of how to use mockery with go generate. It is my preferred way of generating mocks, because the mocks configuration is co-located with the interface definition.

1. Install mockery

```bash
go install github.com/vektra/mockery/v2@2.23.4 # use latest version
```

2. Add a go:generate comment to your interface

```go
//go:generate mockery -name=MyInterface -output=mocks -outpkg=mocks -case=underscore
type MyInterface interface {
    DoSomething()
}

```

3. Run go generate

```bash
go generate ./...
```

September is a communication assistant for people living with neurodegenerative conditions like ALS, MND, or other speech & motor difficulties.

## Background

I was diagnosed with ALS in 2019, and have gradually lost the ability to speak and type. I now rely on a combination of dictation, one-handed typing, and a mouse. However, as my speech became more slurred and my arms weakened, I continued working, coding, and using my computer. I adapted to various combinations of one-handed typing, dictation, and on-screen keyboard. I'm currently using an on-screen keyboard and a head-mounted mouse.

### The Tools I've Used

**GitHub Copilot (2022)**: With the launch of GitHub Copilot, I was able to continue coding and writing everything in VSCode. The AI-driven autocomplete and suggestions were a game-changer. I was able to write e-mails, blog posts, long messages, work documents, and all within the editor. I would copy-paste text to-and-from different platforms like Slack, Google Docs, GMail, etc. While cumbersome, it was an effective way to type faster. I hoped that the Mac's on-screen keyboard would somehow provide a similar experience.

**Voice Banking Challenges**: As my speech slurred, I tried several voice banking apps. All of them required long recordings in quiet environments. It was hard to get a good recording with a 3-year-old in the house during lockdown.

**ElevenLabs Voice Cloning (2023)**: In 2023, ElevenLabs launched their voice cloning technology. This was the first easy way to clone my voice without jumping through hoops. But by then, my speech was already slurred. So I dug through my old hard drives and videos to find old recordings of me speaking. I used these recordings to create a long enough recording to clone my voice. It wasn't perfect, but it was better than everything else.

This journey led me to identify specific daily communication challenges that existing tools couldn't fully address. With the rapid evolution of AI technologies in coding, writing, and speech, I set out to build an application that combines all these different advancements to make communication easier.

## Daily Communication Needs

Despite these technological advances, daily communication remained challenging.

The most common thing I do is talking to people around me. It could be for simple things like asking for water, or telling what I'd like to eat for lunch. Sometimes, it could be video calls with my family and friends. Or just telling my wife about how my day went.

Most often I would compose messages in notes or WhatsApp and have people read them while talking to me. Even with voice cloning, I still need to type out full sentences every time. These tools don't offer auto-complete or suggestions based on previous conversations.

While using head-mouse or eye-tracking devices, clicks are precious. Especially when the vocabulary and sentences used every day are the same, I should not have to type out full phrases and sentences every time.

Beyond daily conversations, I also needed to share longer thoughts and stories. Whether explaining technical concepts to my team, recounting childhood memories to my son, or documenting ideas that might help others facing similar challenges, I found myself writing longer pieces of text. These weren't just messages—they were narratives that I wanted to share with my voice, not just text on a screen.

## The Product: September

These experiences inspired me to build September—a communication platform that combines the best of modern AI technologies to help people communicate effectively with fewer clicks and keystrokes. September brings together auto-complete, suggestions, voice cloning, and speech-to-text into a single, accessible platform designed for people with speech and motor difficulties.
